# Trimaxion
OSINT search window

Trimaxion is a browser extension designed to streamline OSINT investigations by enabling users to perform searches across multiple search engines simultaneously.

This extension opens a search window in a new browser tab, where users can input their search query and click 'Go.' The search term is then simultaneously added to five different search engines, each in a separate tab, providing users with a diverse range of search results. The currently included search engines are DuckDuckGo, Bing, Google, Quant, and Brave search.

Additionally, Trimaxion offers a convenient right-click feature that allows users to highlight text on a webpage and instantly send it to the search window via the context menu.

Please note that Trimaxion is a Chrome browser extension and has been tested on the Brave and Chrome browsers.
